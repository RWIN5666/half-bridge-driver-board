# Tiny Half-Bridge Driver Board

This board has been designed to provide an easy way to add a MOSFET driver with a small footprint to a system. There is no mounting holes but the board can glued (kapton tape applied on the board bottom is recommended !!!).

Although it does not provide as good performance as a board that contains these components with an optimal PCB layout, it can work great. 

## WARNING !

I cannot be held responsible for anything that can happen using this design. 

## Made With Kicad

This board has been designed using [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) EDA and Kicad default component libraries (symbols, footprints and 3D models).
