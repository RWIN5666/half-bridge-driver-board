# Tiny Half-Bridge Driver Board

This board has been designed to provide an easy way to add a MOSFET driver to a System. 
Although it does not provide as good performance as a board that contains these components, it can work great. 

I cannot be held responsible for anything that can happen using this design. 

Feel free to download and improve the design.
